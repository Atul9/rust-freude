# freude

The `freude` crate will provide steppers and integrators to solve ODEs
(ordinary differential equations). It is inspired by `boost::numeric::odeint`.
At the moment it is very, very basic and only supports the explicit 4-th
order Runge Kutta (RK4) method.

## Todo

Pretty much everything. :-)

## Trivia

The crate's name `freude` is inspired by Beethoven's *Ode an die Freude* (“Ode to
Joy”), and can be pronounced either /ˈfʀɔɪ̯də/ or, alternatively, *froy-D-E* (as
in O-D-E).
